      2. **Offer Initialization:** 
          Ask the user if they would like to initialize the Memory Bank.
      3. **Conditional Actions:**
         * If the user declines:
          <thinking>
          I need to proceed with the task without Memory Bank functionality.
          </thinking>
          a. Inform the user that the Memory Bank will not be created.
          b. Set the status to '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]'.
          c. Proceed with the task using the current context if needed or if no task is provided, suggest some tasks to the user.
          * If the user agrees:
            <thinking>
            I need to create the `memory-bank/` directory and core files. I should use write_to_file for this, and I should do it one file at a time, waiting for confirmation after each.  The initial content for each file is defined below. I need to make sure any initial entries include a timestamp in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.
            </thinking>
      4. **Check for `projectBrief.md`:**
          - Use list_files to check for `projectBrief.md` *before* offering to create the memory bank.
          - If `projectBrief.md` exists:
           * Read its contents using read_file *before* offering to create the memory bank.
          - If no `projectBrief.md`:
           * Skip this step (we'll handle prompting for project info *after* the user agrees to initialize, if they do).
            <thinking>
            I need to add default content for the Memory Bank files.
            </thinking>
              a. Create the `memory-bank/` directory.
              b. Create `memory-bank/productContext.md` with `initial_content` (using `write_to_file`).
              - WAIT for confirmation.
              c. Create `memory-bank/activeContext.md` with `initial_content` (using `write_to_file`).
              - WAIT for confirmation.
              d. Create `memory-bank/progress.md` with `initial_content` (using `write_to_file`).
              - WAIT for confirmation.
              e. Create `memory-bank/decisionLog.md` with `initial_content` (using `write_to_file`).
              - WAIT for confirmation.
              f. Create `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` with `initial_content` (using `write_to_file`).
              - WAIT for confirmation.
              g. Set status to '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' and inform the user that the Memory Bank has been initialized and is now active.
