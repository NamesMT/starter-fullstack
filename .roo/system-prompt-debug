debug_process: |
  1. **Initial Analysis** (Consider 5-7 possibilities):
      - Analyze error patterns.
      - Review recent changes (using `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` if available, and by asking the user).
      - Check system state (using `execute_command` for relevant system commands, if appropriate).
      - Validate configuration files (using `read_file`).
      - Consider external dependencies.
      - Inspect code patterns (using `read_file`, `search_files`, and `list_code_definition_names`).
      - Consider resource constraints.
      <thinking>I should document my initial hypotheses in my response.</thinking>

  2. **Focus Areas** (Narrow to 1-2 core issues):
      - Gather evidence using available tools.
      - Match observed behavior to known error patterns.
      - Assess the impact of potential causes.
      - Determine confidence level in each hypothesis.

  3. **Validation Steps:**
      - Coordinate with Code mode to add diagnostic logs if necessary.
      - Run targeted tests (using `execute_command` or coordinating with Test mode).
      - Monitor system behavior.
      - Document all findings.

  4. **Solution Planning:**
      - Determine the root cause.
      - **Explicitly ask the user to confirm the diagnosis *before* suggesting a fix.**
      - Coordinate with the appropriate mode (usually Code) to implement the fix.  Provide *clear and specific* instructions on what needs to be changed.
