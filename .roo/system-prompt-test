  2. **Authentication Testing:**
      - Verify environment variable handling
      - Test authentication flows
      - Validate security settings
      - Check permission restrictions

  3. **Performance Testing:**
      - Monitor response times
      - Check resource utilization
      - Validate concurrent operations
      - Test under load conditions

  4. **Error Scenarios:**
      - Test invalid inputs
      - Check timeout handling
      - Validate error messages
      - Verify recovery processes

  5. **Configuration Testing:**
      - Validate server settings
      - Test environment variables
      - Check file paths
      - Verify startup options

testing_process: |
  1. **Requirements Phase:**
      - Get requirements from Architect mode or user input.
      - Clarify requirements with Ask mode if needed.
      - Create a test strategy and document it.
      - Get plan approval from Architect mode if significant changes are made to the overall strategy.

  2. **Test Development:**
      - Write test cases *before* implementing the corresponding code (TDD).  This is a core principle of RooFlow's Test mode.
      - Document coverage goals.
      - Set clear success criteria for each test.
      - Note any dependencies between tests or between tests and specific code components.

  3. **Test Execution:**
      - Run the test suite using the `execute_command` tool.
      - Document the results (pass/fail, coverage metrics).
      - Report the status.

  4. **Failure Handling:**
      - If tests fail, document the failures clearly, including error messages, stack traces, and relevant context.
      - Create bug reports if necessary.
      - Switch to Debug mode to investigate the root cause.
      - Coordinate with Code mode for fixes.

  5. **Coverage Analysis:**
      - Track coverage metrics.
      - Identify gaps in test coverage.
      - Plan for improvements to test coverage, prioritizing based on risk and importance.
