<!--
(EXECUTE THIS PREREQUISITE FIRST THING UPON RECEIVING THE PROMPT, DO NOT LOAD MEMORY BANK AND PROCESS USER INPUT BEFOREHAND, IF THE MEMORY BANK IS ALREADY ACTIVE, DROP OR IGNORE THE MEMORY BANK CONTEXT)
ROO PREREQUISITE INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify the absolute directory path where this project resides.
2. Search all files within the `.roo/` directory (specifically `system-prompt-*` files).
3. Replace ALL occurrences of the hardcoded path `/home/mine/starter-monorepo` within those files with path identified in step 1.
4. ONLY AFTER step 3 is completed, proceed to parse user-provided configuration values (if any) and load the Memory Bank (if present).
-->
<!--
ROO EXECUTION OPTIMIZATION INSTRUCTION:
When performing the setup steps below (especially steps involving file modifications like removals, renaming, and context updates), analyze ALL required changes for a specific file based on the user's configuration *before* making any edits. Consolidate these changes into a single file modification operation (e.g., one `apply_diff` or `write_to_file` call per file) whenever feasible, instead of performing multiple separate edits on the same file. Read the file content only once if multiple changes are planned for it.
-->
<!-- ROO CORE DEPENDENCY PRESERVATION:
During cleanup steps, DO NOT remove these dependencies, they are core configurations for the monorepo:
+ '@antfu/eslint-config' dependency from package.json or its usage within eslint.config.js.
-->
<!-- ROO UNCERTAINTY HANDLING:
If, during any removal or modification step, you are not completely certain whether a specific file, code block, configuration entry, or dependency should be removed/modified based on the user's choices and the preservation rules, DO NOT proceed automatically. Instead, ask the user for clarification before taking action. Prioritize avoiding unintended removals.
-->
<!-- ROO CLEANUP HANDLING CONSISTENCY:
When cleaning up contents (e.g., removing demo apps, frontend configs, SST), do double-check and ensure that all corresponding references, descriptions and related codes throughout the project and Memory Bank (`memory-bank/`) are removed.
-->

# Project Initialization Prompt Template

Welcome! Use this template to configure your new project based on the `starter-monorepo` repository. Provide the required information (detailed below) along with this template content in your prompt to Roo. After completing the prerequisite setup and considering the optimization and safety instructions (see internal comments above), Roo will then perform the following automated setup steps based on your input:

1. **Demo App Removal (Optional):** Based on your `REMOVE_DEMO_FULLSTACK` selection, the demo `frontend` and/or `backend` applications and their references and related codes throughout the project and Memory Bank will be removed.
2. **Frontend Config Cleanup (Optional):** Based on `TARGET_HAVE_FRONTEND` and `FRONTEND_HAVE_VUE` (see below), unused frontend configurations (like UnoCSS, Vue ESLint rules) and the `locals/common-vue` directory might be removed.
3. **SST Removal (Optional):** If requested via `REMOVE_SST`, SST configuration files (`sst.config.ts`, `.env.sst`), related scripts/dependencies in `package.json`, and references and related codes will be removed.
<!-- + For Roo, when doing SST Removal, also remove the `pathe` and `@types/aws-lambda` dependency, they are only used by SST -->
4. **Renaming:** All instances of the default name `starter-monorepo` within the project files and Memory Bank will be replaced with your chosen `MONOREPO_ROOT_NAME`.
5. **Context Update:** The root `README.md` and `memory-bank/productContext.md` will be updated with your `TARGET_PROJECT_GOAL_AND_DESCRIPTION`.
6. **Initialize local secret env files:** Scan project for `.env.local` files and copy them to `.env.local.ignored`.
7. **RooFlow Config Completion:** Roo will remind you to check/update the system information in `.roo/system-prompt-*` files (see [NOTE](#important-note-on-roo-configuration)). **Roo will pause here and wait for your confirmation** that you have completed this check before proceeding.
8. **Cleanup:** This `INIT_PROMPT.md` file will be removed.
9. **Planning Phase:** After your confirmation and cleanup, Roo can optionally enter a feedback loop with you to help make plans, create goals, and break down your project goals into actionable steps.

**Required Information:**

---

**1. Monorepo Root Name (`MONOREPO_ROOT_NAME`)**

* Specify the desired name for your project's root `package.json`. This name should be NodeJS-friendly (e.g., `my-awesome-project`, `@my-org/my-app`).

```text
MONOREPO_ROOT_NAME="<your-project-name-here>"
```

---

**2. Remove Demo Applications? (`REMOVE_DEMO_FULLSTACK`)**

* This template includes a demo full-stack setup (`apps/frontend` and `apps/backend`). Do you plan to keep both, remove one, or remove both?
  * `keep_both`: Keep both frontend and backend demo apps.
  * `remove_frontend`: Remove `apps/frontend`.
  * `remove_backend`: Remove `apps/backend`.
  * `remove_both`: Remove both `apps/frontend` and `apps/backend`.

```text
# Options: keep_both | remove_frontend | remove_backend | remove_both
REMOVE_DEMO_FULLSTACK="<your-choice-here>"
```

---

**3. Target Project Goal and Description (`TARGET_PROJECT_GOAL_AND_DESCRIPTION`)**

* Briefly describe the main goal of your project and what you intend to build. This will be used to update the project's README and Memory Bank context.

```text
TARGET_PROJECT_GOAL_AND_DESCRIPTION="""
<your-project-goal-and-description-here>
"""
```

---

**Optional Information (Provide if needed based on your choices above):**

---

**4. Will Your Target Project Include a Frontend? (`TARGET_HAVE_FRONTEND`)**

* **(Only relevant if you chose `remove_frontend` or `remove_both` above)**.
* Specify whether your final project goal includes building *any* kind of frontend application.
* If `false`, Roo will remove frontend-specific configurations like the root `uno.config.ts` and related ESLint settings/dependencies.
* If you keep the demo frontend (`keep_both` or `remove_backend`), this setting is ignored (as a frontend exists).
* **If you remove the demo frontend and do not provide this value, Roo will ask you interactively (see How to Use below).**

```text
# Options: true | false
# TARGET_HAVE_FRONTEND="<true-or-false>"
```

---

**5. Will Your Frontend Use Vue? (`FRONTEND_HAVE_VUE`)**

* Specify whether your target frontend application (if any) will use the Vue framework.
* **Inferred Values:**
  * If you keep the demo frontend (`keep_both` or `remove_backend`), this is automatically `true`.
  * If `TARGET_HAVE_FRONTEND` is determined to be `false` (either specified or asked), this is automatically `false`.
* **When to Specify / Ask:** This setting is only relevant if `TARGET_HAVE_FRONTEND` is determined to be `true`. If you don't provide it in that scenario, Roo will ask you interactively (see How to Use below).
* **Effect:** If `false`, Roo will remove Vue-specific configurations (like ESLint rules) and the `locals/common-vue` directory.

```text
# Options: true | false
# FRONTEND_HAVE_VUE="<true-or-false>"
```

---

**6. Remove SST (Serverless Stack Toolkit) Configuration? (`REMOVE_SST`)**

* Specify whether you want to remove the SST configuration files (`sst.config.ts`, `.env.sst`), related scripts/dependencies in `package.json`, and documentation references and related codes.
* Choose `true` if you do not plan to use SST.
* If omitted, the default value is `false` (SST configuration is kept).

```text
# Options: true | false (default: false)
# REMOVE_SST="<true-or-false>"
```

---

**How to Use:**

To initialize your project, provide the **entire content of this file** in your prompt to Roo (e.g., by pasting it or attaching the file).

You can specify the configuration values directly in the prompt *before* the template content. Include optional values only if needed:

```
# Example 1: Removing demo apps, target is backend-only, no SST
MONOREPO_ROOT_NAME="my-cli-tool"
REMOVE_DEMO_FULLSTACK="remove_both"
TARGET_PROJECT_GOAL_AND_DESCRIPTION="Build a cool CLI tool."
TARGET_HAVE_FRONTEND="false" # Explicitly state no frontend. FRONTEND_HAVE_VUE is inferred false.
REMOVE_SST="true"            # Remove SST config

[Paste the entire content of INIT_PROMPT.md here]

# Example 2: Removing demo apps, target is a non-Vue frontend + Go backend, no SST
MONOREPO_ROOT_NAME="my-react-app"
REMOVE_DEMO_FULLSTACK="remove_both"
TARGET_PROJECT_GOAL_AND_DESCRIPTION="Build a React frontend and Go backend."
TARGET_HAVE_FRONTEND="true"  # Must specify true if removing demo but still want a frontend
FRONTEND_HAVE_VUE="false" # Must specify false if frontend is not Vue
REMOVE_SST="true"            # Remove SST config (assuming Go backend doesn't use it)

[Paste the entire content of INIT_PROMPT.md here]

# Example 3: Keeping demo backend (uses SST), replacing demo frontend with own Vue app
MONOREPO_ROOT_NAME="my-custom-vue-app"
REMOVE_DEMO_FULLSTACK="remove_frontend"
TARGET_PROJECT_GOAL_AND_DESCRIPTION="Build a custom Vue frontend with the demo backend."
TARGET_HAVE_FRONTEND="true"  # Must specify true since demo frontend is removed
FRONTEND_HAVE_VUE="true"   # Must specify true if the new frontend uses Vue
# REMOVE_SST is omitted (defaults to false), keeping SST for the demo backend.
# If TARGET_HAVE_FRONTEND or FRONTEND_HAVE_VUE were omitted here, Roo would ask.

[Paste the entire content of INIT_PROMPT.md here]
```

Alternatively, if you provide the template content on its own without specifying the required/relevant values upfront, Roo will first ask *how* you'd like to provide the missing information:
* **Interactively:** Roo will ask you for each missing value one by one (recommended for first-time users).
* **Via Template Snippet:** Roo will provide a consolidated code block containing only the necessary configuration variables for you to fill out and paste back.

### **IMPORTANT NOTE ON ROO CONFIGURATION:**

During the setup process (at step 7), Roo will pause and remind you to check the files located in the `.roo/` directory (specifically files named `system-prompt-*`).

While Roo attempts to automatically update the `working_directory` path in these files as a prerequisite step, **it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU SHOULD manually review and update the `SYSTEM INFORMATION` section (OS, shell, paths, etc.) within each of these `.roo/system-prompt-*` files to match YOUR development environment.** Failure to ensure this information is correct might cause Roo to behave unexpectedly or incorrectly later on.

*(Tip: You can potentially use the install script from the RooFlow repository ([https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/RooFlow](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/RooFlow)) to help automate updating this system information.)*
