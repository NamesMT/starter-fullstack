# starter-fullstack

This is a starter template to kick-start your `Nuxt` full-stack project

## What's inside?

This template is powered by [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo)

### Apps and Packages

- `frontend`: a [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) app, configured same as [starter-nuxt](https://github.com/NamesMT/starter-nuxt).
- `backend`: a [HonoðŸ”¥](https://hono.dev/) app.
- `@local/common`: a shared library that can contain components, functions, types shared across the apps.
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo.

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
