# backend [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/backend?color=a1b858&label=)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/backend)

**backend** is the main backend/API server for the project, powered by [HonoðŸ”¥](https://hono.dev/)

## Features
- [x] Easy cross-function calls / Lambda triggers support with [hono-adapter-aws-lambda](https://github.com/NamesMT/hono-adapter-aws-lambda)

## Structuring cookbook:
#### Root level:
Things like 3rd party APIs, DBs, Storages connectors, etc, should be placed in `~/providers` folder, grouped by their purpose if possible, e.g: `~/providers/auth/kinde-main.ts`, `~/providers/auth/google-main.ts`.

Things that interact with `~/providers` should be placed in `~/services` folder. (like an `user` service)

Other globally reuseable code should be placed in `~/helpers` folder.

Locally reusable code should be placed in the same folder as the file that uses it, its name should be its usable scope, suffixing the file name with `.helper`, e.g: `/api/hello.helper.ts`, `/api/app.helper.ts`.

#### `api` folder:
You could create folders to group/prefix the routes, e.g: `/api/auth` folder.

The main app entry should be `app.ts`.

Each route should be placed in a separate file according to the route path, e.g: `/api/hello.ts`, `/api/greet.ts`,  
Alternatively, you could create a `routes.ts` for multiple routes declaration in file one, e.g: `/api/auth/routes.ts`.

#### `import` order:
The import order is as following, and they should be separated with a line break:

1. Package imports
2. Alias imports
3. Relative imports

e.g:
```ts
import { env } from 'std-env'

import { appFactory } from '~/factory'

import { apiApp } from './api/app'
```
