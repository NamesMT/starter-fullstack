`Primevue` is your traditional UI library where everything couples together closely, and `shadcn` is a components-based UI library, in which you only installs what you use, i.e, instead of you installing "`embla-carousel`" and implements a `Carousel` component yourself, `shadcn` will help you do it easily with a command, and provides you with some pre-made document, wrappers component and their styling system. `Primevue` and `shadcn` could work together pretty smoothly and will not bloat the application compared to cases like `PrimeVue` + `Vuetify`, the project is set up like this in case you prefer to use a more traditional UI library like PrimeVue while still benefiting from the flexibility and customization features of `shadcn` as needed.
